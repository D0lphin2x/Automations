# ‚è± Workday Time Logger Automation (macOS + Selenium)

This Python script automatically logs 8 hours of time in Workday using Selenium and Microsoft Edge. It is designed to be run daily at a set time (e.g., 5 PM) and handles the login and time entry for you, bypassing 2FA via a persistent browser profile.
